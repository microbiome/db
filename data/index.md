Database description
=====


This is a custom database that supports the XXX project execution.

We have collected sequenced and fully annotated reference genomes for
human gut bacteria. Currently this list includes 823 bacterial
species.


### Data access

Download the database by following [this
link](Gastrointestinal_tract.nuc.fsa)


### Details of data retrieval

The reference sequences for annotated bacterial genomes were
downloaded from [HMP reference genomes
database](https://www.hmpdacc.org/hmp/catalog/) (accessed March 18,
2018). The FASTA (ASM) files for [bacterial genomes from the human
gastrointestinal tract](Gastrointestinal_tract.nuc.fsa) were
[retrieved](https://www.hmpdacc.org/hmp/HMRGD/), yielding 823 genome
sequences. These include both high-quality draft sequences, and a
smaller number of completed genomes.


### Database maintenance and updates

This custom database will be updated when new sequenced and properly
annotated reference genomes from the human gut microbiota become
available. The project coordinator can be contacted for further
details (see [contact](../contact/)).
