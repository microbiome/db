Database description
=====


**This custom database has been designed to support the XXX project execution**

The database contains sequenced and fully annotated reference genomes
for the human gut bacteria from public sources. Currently this
includes 823 genome sequences for microbial (mostly bacterial)
organisms from the human gastrointestinal tract.

**Data access** The following data sets are provided for download:
  * [Metadata](project_catalog.csv) of the included genome sequences
  * [FASTA](Gastrointestinal_tract.nuc.fsa) Genome sequence database in FASTA format
  * [Genbank]() Genome sequence database in Genbank format

**Data description** Metadata for 745 of the genome sequences (90.5%)
  is summarized in [project_catalog.csv](project_catalog.csv),
  including information of organism name, domain, gene count, the
  current sequencing quality, HMP/GOLD/NCBI/Genbank/IMG/HDMD IDs,
  sequencing center, and other information. The data set contains 737
  bacterial genomes and 2 archaeal genomes. For further 6 genomes the
  domain information was not listed in the original data source but
  could be manually classified into the bacterial domain in all
  cases. The data collection includes both quality draft sequences
  (308; 41%), and completed genomes (437; 59%). For further details of
  genome annotation, see the [Genbank file]().

**Details of data retrieval and database construction** The reference
sequences for annotated bacterial genomes were downloaded from [HMP
reference genomes database](https://www.hmpdacc.org/hmp/catalog/). We
filtered the results to include only bacterial genomes from the [human
gastrointestinal
tract](https://www.hmpdacc.org/hmp/catalog/grid.php?dataset=genomic&hmp_isolation_body_site=gastrointestinal_tract)
(accessed March 18, 2018), yielding 823 genome sequences. This data
collection was stored in [FASTA (ASM)]() and [Genbank]() formats.


**Database maintenance and updates** This custom database will be
updated when new sequenced and fully annotated reference genomes from
the human gut microbiota become available. Contact the project
coordinator for further details (see [contact](contact.html)).
