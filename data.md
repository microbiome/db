Database description
=====


**This custom database has been designed to support the XXX project execution**

The database contains sequenced and fully annotated reference genomes
for the human gut bacteria from public sources. Currently this
includes 823 bacterial species from the human gastrointestinal tract.


**Data access**

Download the custom [database in FASTA format](Gastrointestinal_tract.nuc.fsa).


**Details of data retrieval** The reference sequences for annotated
bacterial genomes were downloaded from [HMP reference genomes
database](https://www.hmpdacc.org/hmp/catalog/) (accessed March 18,
2018). The FASTA (ASM) files for bacterial genomes from the human
gastrointestinal tract were
[retrieved](https://www.hmpdacc.org/hmp/HMRGD/), yielding 823 genome
sequences. These include both high-quality draft sequences, and a
smaller number of completed genomes. For details, see the Genbank file
format.


**Database maintenance and updates** This custom database will be
updated when new sequenced and fully annotated reference genomes from
the human gut microbiota become available. Contact the project
coordinator for further details (see [contact](../contact/)).
